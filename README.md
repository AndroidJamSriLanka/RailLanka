"RailLanka" - A Train Schedule Application
========================================

<b>Motivation<b/><br />
Since the train is the cheapest public travelling option
in the Sri Lanka, many people try to travel by a train
rather than a bus. But due to number of trains are limited
in Sri Lanka, it may be hard to catch a train without 
knowing exact time table and availability of trains.
"RailLanka" will be a great solution for that issue.
It is a simple but yet powerful android application that
could be used to search trains between given train stations
and time period.
	
<b>Existing Solutions<b/><br />
There are some other railway schedule applications already
exist in the Google Paly. But most of those have several
drawbacks. Some applications doesn't even suggest the train
station names while another one missing some essential
features like search history, offline search... etc.
	
<b>Objectives and Scope of Proposed Project<b/><br /> 
» Provide a platform for easily search a train by entering 
  start station and end station with better GUI experience.<br />
» Provide a option to search a train within specific time
  period and day.<br />
» Provide a option to save search results for offline use.<br />
» Provide a option to share search results

<b>Future Development Ideas<b/><br />
» Enable Sinhala language in the application.<br />
» Add a train time reminder notification feature.
	
<b>Feasibility of Proposed Project<b/><br /> 
Since there is a public API provided by ICTA, it is possible
to easily get the relevant information.
