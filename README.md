"RailLanka" - A Train Schedule Application
-------------------------------------------

#### Motivation
Since the train is the cheapest public travelling option in the Sri Lanka, many people try to travel by a train rather than a bus. But due to number of trains are limited in Sri Lanka, it may be hard to catch a train without knowing exact time table and availability of trains. "RailLanka" will be a great solution for that issue. It is a simple but yet powerful android application that could be used to search trains between given train stations and time period.
	
#### Existing Solutions
There are some other railway schedule applications already exist in the Google Paly. But most of those have several drawbacks. Some applications doesn't even suggest the train station names while another one missing some essential features like search history, offline search... etc.
	
#### Objectives and Scope of Proposed Project
- Provide a platform for easily search a train by entering start station and end station with better GUI experience.
- Provide a option to search a train within specific time
  period and day.
- Provide a option to save search results for offline use.
- Provide a option to share search results

#### Future Development Ideas
- Enable Sinhala language in the application.
- Add a train time reminder notification feature.
	
#### Feasibility of Proposed Project
Since there is a public API provided by ICTA, it is possible
to easily get the relevant information.
